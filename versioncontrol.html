        <h1>Version Control</h1>
        <p>
            Version control is a system that helps you manage changes to your projects' source code over time. By using version control, you can track and record changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Popular version control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial. Git, in particular, is widely used due to its distributed nature, robust branching and merging capabilities, and strong community support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some benefits of using version control:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Collaboration**: Allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.</li>
            <li>**Tracking Changes**: Keeps a detailed history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.</li>
            <li>**Branching and Merging**: Facilitates working on new features or fixes independently, then merging them into the main project.</li>
            <li>**Backup**: Acts as a backup system for your code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding and utilizing version control is essential for efficient project management and collaboration. Whether you're working solo or with a team, version control systems can greatly enhance your workflow and productivity.
